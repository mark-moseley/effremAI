The gostak distims the doshes.

This is pseudocode.

The "gostak" is a half-gene. The gostak-gene requires a dosh-gene in order to create a brand-new living being.

That living being is assumed to be a new "gostak" or a new "dosh". It could be something totally new, of course, because mutations happen.

effremAI will answer the question: "can an assumed 'gostak' become a 'dosh' or vice-versa?"
