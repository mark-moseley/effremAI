# effremAI
The gostak distims the doshes.

This is pseudocode.

The "gostak" is a half-gene. The gostak-gene requires a dosh-gene in order to create a brand-new living being.

That living being is assumed to be a new "gostak" or a new "dosh". It could be something totally new, of course, because mutations happen.

effremAI will answer the question: "can an assumed 'gostak' become a 'dosh' or vice-versa?"

Version 0.2: consciousness
===========================
Implement pain that the AI simulates feeling. Require periodic feedings, or the AI dies. As the AI begins to starve it will behave (completely rationally) violently. If it can get "fed" by killing something, like another AI, it will. In the future, "AI" will be a group of AI implementations with different "life experiences" and possibly different code as well. They'll feed on each other, or, on simulated animals and/or plants.
